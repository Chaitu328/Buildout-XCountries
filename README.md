# Project Overview: Country Flag Viewer
### Overview

The Country Flag Viewer is a React-based web application that fetches and displays country flags and their names from a remote API. The application features a responsive design, with cards displaying each country's flag and name. It includes error handling to ensure users are informed of any issues during data fetching, providing a smooth user experience.
Description

The Country Flag Viewer application serves as an educational tool and a showcase of fundamental React concepts, including component-based architecture, state management, and asynchronous data fetching. The project is structured to provide clear separation of concerns, with dedicated components for rendering country data and handling API interactions.

### Key features of the application include:

Dynamic Data Fetching: Utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve data from a remote server.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to manage failed API requests gracefully.
Responsive Design: Ensures a visually appealing layout across various devices using CSS modules.
Component-Based Architecture: Breaks down the UI into reusable components for maintainability and scalability.

The project is also designed to be easily testable with tools like Cypress, ensuring that any errors in data fetching are appropriately logged and handled.
Technical Stack

React: For building the user interface.
React Router: For managing navigation within the application.
CSS Modules: For scoped and maintainable CSS styling.
Fetch API: For asynchronous data fetching.
Cypress: For end-to-end testing.
